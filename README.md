# Description

I am trying to train a model to find the bounding boxes of simple shapes in generated images.
This is a spin-off from a larger project to create a web app to scan a Sudoku puzzle from a
newspaper or magazine etc. and then display the solution.

I wanted the scanning part of the web app to be entirely based on [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) trained models. However, I failed to get this working. Specifically,
I failed to train a model to find the bounding boxes of the Sudoku puzzles. In the end,
I had to use [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/4.1.1/d5/d10/tutorial_js_root.html) for this step.
